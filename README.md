# Black-Plasma-Studios-Rig-for-Blender-Internal
A few of the older BPS rigs that I've modified for the older versions of Blender, when internal rendering/Blender rendering still existed. For those still using Internal/Blender Render, feel free to take them! For those concerned, I'm not bootlegging a purchased product; the original rig is free to download for everyone.

All credit goes to PixelFrosty, the initial creator of the rig, and Black Plasma Studios itself, who have put out the original rig for release!
